## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)
1. Use your preferred FTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
2. Upload ALL files from the `dist/` folder to your web server root
3. Preserve the folder structure during upload

### Option 2: Git-Based Deployment
If your website auto-deploys from Git:
```bash
# Copy files from dist to root (if needed)
# Then commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy i18n system and explorer links"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is configured for automatic deployment.
Just push changes to the main branch.

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

After deployment, test these URLs:

- **English**: https://burnitoken.website
- **German**: https://burnitoken.website?lang=de

### Verify These Features:

- [ ] Language selector dropdown appears in navigation
- [ ] Clicking German changes all text to German
- [ ] Clicking English changes all text back to English
- [ ] Explorer links work in Token Details section
- [ ] All navigation items are translated
- [ ] Hero section shows "Willkommen bei Burni!" in German

## 🔧 Local Testing

To test locally before deployment:
```bash

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If the i18n system doesn't work after deployment:

4. **Test locally** to confirm functionality
5. **Check file permissions** on the server
